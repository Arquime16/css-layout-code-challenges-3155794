# CSS Layout Code Challenges

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `CSS Layout Code Challenges`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

All the exercise files in this repository are available from the `main` branch. Each movie has one challenge, and the files for each challenge are contained in folders following the `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#` naming convention. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter. For each challenge there is also a solution contained in the `XX_XX_solution` folder.

## Notes

The repository contains two folders named `css` and `assets`. These contain global styles and an SVG used throughout the different challenge movies. In the exercise files for each challenge there is an `index.html` file containing all relevant HTML, and a `current-style.css` file containing CSS to get you started. All your CSS work will be done in the `current-style.css` file for the current challenge. In some challenges you may also need to make changes to `index.html`.
